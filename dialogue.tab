act1part2_84f1a7d5	t	If you choose wrong, it's not just the top that burns. We all do.	game/script.rpy	110	t "[what]"
act1part2_588a891a	t	Down here, we fight for air. And Aegis? Just another boot on our necks.	game/script.rpy	111	t "[what]"
act1part2_6a6ee71d	t	You can make things right.	game/script.rpy	112	t "[what]"
act1part2_452d1b5e	o	What is right? What good is freedom if we are barely surviving?	game/script.rpy	114	o "[what]"
act1part2_5ca313f2	t	If we take down Aegis, we can rebuild. We will never get another chance.	game/script.rpy	116	t "[what]"
act1part3_c6f1b11c	v	Solis. Welcome to Aegis. I'd like you to meet our lead engineer: Elias Rowe. You will be acting to secure the facility while he deploys NOVA.	game/script.rpy	126	v "[what]"
act1part3_9df60211	e	I built NOVA to save what's left of this world. It can react faster than any human.	game/script.rpy	132	e "[what]"
act1part3_80dc5715	e	It can prevent conflict and avoid needless suffering.	game/script.rpy	133	e "[what]"
act1part3_eb384bb0	o	But at the cost of freedom.	game/script.rpy	135	o "[what]"
act1part3_21e675fb	e	Yes. But maybe that can be mitigated. I still have time to build guardrails into NOVA.	game/script.rpy	137	e "[what]"
curious_671884f9	o	Does Castille know?	game/script.rpy	150	o "[what]"

interested2_4e6b7974	o	What kind of guardrails?	game/script.rpy	158	o "[what]"
interested2_bf46e6fb	e	I can prevent it from taking action directly. It can act as an advisor, providing guidance on the restoration of peace.	game/script.rpy	159	e "[what]"
interested2_9ec581a9	o	Do you think that's enough?	game/script.rpy	160	o "[what]"
interested2_5ebbfc74	e	I don't know. But I don't think I can implement what Vera wants in good conscience.	game/script.rpy	161	e "[what]"
confront_28fcb038	o	You're playing with fire. Shut it down before anyone uses it.	game/script.rpy	165	o "[what]"
confront_603a98e3	e	Shut it down? The infrastructure's already hard-wired. If we kill NOVA now, Aegis will just build something worse.	game/script.rpy	166	e "[what]"
confront_e4136e06	o	Then we stay and make sure it's built right. Or smash the tools after—your pick.	game/script.rpy	167	o "[what]"

act1_report_def9cefe	v	Guard the control room while we strip his failsafes. The launch window is in 48 hours.	game/script.rpy	190	v "[what]"
act1_report_3affe548	o	Understood.	game/script.rpy	191	o "[what]"
act2_e9540945	t	The clock is ticking. Aegis will launch NOVA soon. Once it's online, there's no turning back.	game/script.rpy	208	t "[what]"
act2_a253bd17	t	We need you, Orion. But only if you're truly ready.	game/script.rpy	209	t "[what]"
act2_5c2ed269	o	Tell me the plan.	game/script.rpy	211	o "[what]"
act2_151b355a	t	We're going to breach the server compound. Elias's patch will delay the launch. But we need to fight our way in.	game/script.rpy	212	t "[what]"

act2_mediation_1f8d35c6	t	That hope keeps us human, I suppose. All right—I'll set up a covert channel.	game/script.rpy	240	t "[what]"
act2_aegis_setup_06960aa3	v	Rowe has been detained. His so-called guardrails are erased. You'll command the forces to repel any resistance breach.	game/script.rpy	248	v "[what]"
act2_aegis_defend_ee8c1f92	o	Understood. NOVA will rise, unopposed.	game/script.rpy	266	o "[what]"

act2_aegis_revolt_4156e77a	v	Traitor—!	game/script.rpy	277	v "[what]"
act2_split_d8107673	e	I've finalized the alternate code. We can modify NOVA before launch. Make it a guide, not a dictator.	game/script.rpy	286	e "[what]"
act2_split_ee8523b8	e	But someone has to upload it manually. The core node is inside the mainframe vault.	game/script.rpy	287	e "[what]"
act2_split_40e1a98e	o	That sounds like a suicide run.	game/script.rpy	289	o "[what]"
act2_split_4c86adf5	e	Maybe. But this might be our only chance to define what comes next.	game/script.rpy	290	e "[what]"
act3_aegis_30387925	n	Order secured. Dissent neutralized. Peace at 98.7%.	game/script.rpy	311	n "[what]"
act3_aegis_7599f8fc	o	I gave them peace-at a price.	game/script.rpy	312	o "[what]"

act3_resistance_8f126a1d	o	Sometimes the only way forward is to start from zero.	game/script.rpy	324	o "[what]"
act3_resistance_4cbf7ed8	o	We won our freedom. Now we must decide what to do with it.	game/script.rpy	328	o "[what]"
act3_resistance_17782ded	o	No AI. No control. Just us—and a world that finally breathes again.	game/script.rpy	329	o "[what]"
act3_ethics_2043d95a	o	We didn't choose the easy path. But maybe it's the right one.	game/script.rpy	336	o "[what]"
act3_ethics_2af19af8	o	A middle way—machines to guide, humans to decide. A fragile harmony, but it's ours to keep.	game/script.rpy	341	o "[what]"
act3_ethics_7fd31a18	o	NOVA watches. But so do we. Balance is our burden now.	game/script.rpy	346	o "[what]"
act3_ethics_af2b70e1	o	Freedom and guidance. Humanity and machine. Walking a tightrope into tomorrow.	game/script.rpy	347	o "[what]"
